                    <h1><span class="highlight">My Journey</span></h1>
                    <p>My interest in Robotics & Automation began during my school years, where I enjoyed hands-on learning and participated in science fairs and competitions. Alongside academics, I was involved in extracurricular activities like voluntering and sports, which helped me develop skills in teamwork and leadership.</p>
                    <p>Transitioning to college has been both exciting and challenging. College life has offered me the freedom to explore my passion for robotics more deeply while also teaching me the importance of time management and self-discipline. Meeting new people, joining clubs, and working on group projects have expanded my social and technical skills.</p>
                    <p>I’m excited to continue this journey, combining my academic knowledge with real-world experiences to contribute to the future of automation and robotics.</p>
